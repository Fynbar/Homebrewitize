When creating a Dancer, you must consider where they have honed their craft.",
                                "Did they pick up the profession naturally, teaching themselves over long hours, or did they study beneath some kind of mentor? One must consider their motivations, does your Dancer seek fame and fortune, or do they want to bring the gifts of joy to the masses. Perhaps they are going on their journey in an attempt to hone their craft even further. What drives your character to go beyond a normal dancer, and actually fight? Talk to your DM about the role dancers might have in your campaign's societies.",

As he aged, Jahad chose to seal the kinglier aspects of his soul into this, his magnum opus, so that future lords could benefit from his wisdom and so that the order of Dragon Knights could continue to perform the dragon blood ritual he designed, which requires his magic as a component. Slumbering alone in the depths of the Dragon Knight’s fortress Castle Jahad, it grows restless... Its pommel and guard are made of a complex alloy of gold, silver, copper, bronze, and brass, bejeweled by a ruby, sapphire, emerald, onyx, and diamond. The blade is embossed with ancient runes of the giant folk that Jahad had learned in his younger days of adventure. In its exalted state, its runes increase in complexity, and amethyst, quartz, moonstone, and topaz gems appear encrusted on its surface.",
